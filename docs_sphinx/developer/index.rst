Developer's guide
=================

This section is intended as a guide to how Brian functions internally for
people developing Brian itself, or extensions to Brian. It may also be of some
interest to others wishing to better understand how Brian works internally.

The documents here are the parts of brian2 that are finished or at least
substantially advanced. See the :doc:`notes/index` section for documents
describing planned features, discussions and general thoughts.
