Cannot find msvcr90d.dll
------------------------

If you see this message coming up, find the file
``PythonDir\Lib\site-packages\numpy\distutils\mingw32ccompiler.py``
and modify the line ``msvcr_dbg_success = build_msvcr_library(debug=True)`` to read
``msvcr_dbg_success = False`` (you can comment out the existing line and add the new line
immediately after).

"Missing compiler_cxx fix for MSVCCompiler"
-------------------------------------------

If you keep seeing this message, do not worry. It's not possible for us to
hide it, but doesn't indicate any problems.

Problems with numerical integration
-----------------------------------

In some cases, the automatic choice of numerical integration method will not be
appropriate, because of a choice of parameters that couldn't be determined in
advance. In this case, typically you will get nan (not a number) values in the
results, or large oscillations. In this case, Brian will generate a warning to
let you know, but will not raise an error.

Integer division
----------------

If you are using integer division in your models for negative numbers, the results
will be different if using the numpy target to any of the other codegen targets.
This is because in Python, ``-1/2==-1`` whereas in C, ``-1/2==0``. This will be
fixed in a future release.
