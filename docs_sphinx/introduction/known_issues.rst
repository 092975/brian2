------------------------

If you see this message coming up, find the file
``PythonDir\Lib\site-packages\numpy\distutils\mingw32ccompiler.py``
and modify the line ``msvcr_dbg_success = build_msvcr_library(debug=True)`` to read
``msvcr_dbg_success = False`` (you can comment out the existing line and add the new line
immediately after).
