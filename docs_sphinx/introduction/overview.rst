Overview
========

Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in the Python
programming language and is available on almost all platforms. We believe
that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the
time of scientists. Brian is therefore designed to be easy to learn and use,
highly flexible and easily extensible.

To get an idea of what writing a simulation in Brian looks like, take a look
at :doc:`a simple example </examples/CUBA>`, or run our
`interactive demo <http://mybinder.org/repo/brian-team/brian2-binder/notebooks/demo.ipynb>`_.

You can actually edit and run the examples in the browser without having to
install Brian, using the Binder service (note: sometimes this service is down
or running slowly):

Once you have a feel for what is involved in using Brian, we recommend you
start by following the
:doc:`installation instructions </introduction/install>`, then going
through the :doc:`tutorials </resources/tutorials/index>`, and finally
reading the :doc:`User Guide </user/index>`.
