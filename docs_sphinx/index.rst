Brian 2 documentation
=====================

Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in the Python
programming language and is available on almost all platforms. We believe
that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the
time of scientists. Brian is therefore designed to be easy to learn and use,
highly flexible and easily extensible.

For new users, take a look at the :doc:`Overview </introduction/overview>`.
